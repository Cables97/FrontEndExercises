## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See pageviews and price to raise with the range slider
- Monthly/yearly billing effects the price

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Throughout this project I was reminded how each browser handles some elements differently. Particularly the input type='range'. 

Firefox (my main browser) handles range sliders easily, with simple tags to access the track or thumb.

Chrome either does not allow for a developer to manipulate the range slider as thoroughly, or their documentation does not mention it. 

Also adding an icon to display overtop of a range thumb is obtuse, unless  the range slider is built from scratch with JS.
